                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime
                environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web
                browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command
                line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts
                server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page
                is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
                represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying
                web-application development around a single programming
                language, rather than different languages for server- and
                client-side scripts. Though .js is the standard filename
                extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer
                to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of
                the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of
                asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize
                throughput and scalability in web applications with many
                input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web
                applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser
                games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project was
                previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now
                merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation,
                which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative
                Projects program.[9] Corporate users of Node.js software include
                GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12] LinkedIn,[13][14]
                Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] Rakuten,
                SAP,[20] Voxer,[21] Walmart,[22] and Yahoo!.[23]

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p>
                Java is a general-purpose programming language that is
                class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17]
                meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
                support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java
                applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
                any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and
                C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
                As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming
                languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for
                client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million
                developers.[21] Java was originally developed by James Gosling
                at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle)
                and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'
                Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java
                compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally
                released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in
                compliance with the specifications of the Java Community
                Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under
                the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed
                alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as
                the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath
                (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for
                applets). The latest versions are Java 14, released in March
                2020, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS)
                version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the
                legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019
                for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8
                with public updates for personal use up to at least December
                2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older
                versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved
                security issues.[22] Since Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are no longer
                supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to
                the latest version (currently Java 14) or an LTS release.
